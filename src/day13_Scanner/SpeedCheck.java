3. Write a program for the speed check.
		a variable named speedLimit is given and assigned, ask user to enter the current speed, if the current speed is over the speedLimit print slow down, otherwise do not print anything
		Ex:
			speedLimit = 55;
			Enter current speed:
			105
			output:
			You're driving 50 mph over the limit. Slow down!
			Enter current speed:
			45
			output:
